  * Fix some signedness and missing return values that resulted
    in incorrect error messages being reported.
  * Don't overwrite existing error code if xd3_close_stream
    fails. This caused write errors to be mis-reported.
  * Don't lseek() target/delta fds because this behaviour might
    be surprising
  * Throw exceptions when closed or memory-mapped file handles
    are passed in instead of regular files.
